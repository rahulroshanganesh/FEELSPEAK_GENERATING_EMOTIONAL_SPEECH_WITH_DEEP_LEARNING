HAPPY
Ha Ha, this joke is so funny to laugh
I am happy to work on this project
What a blissful day! Good morning
Waaaaw!, this car is amazing!
I'm so excited to go on vacation next week.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAD
Alas, I lost all my project data due to a technical glitch with tacotron
Oh, I feel grieved depressed about the mournful incident
I am sad to work on this project
In sooth I know not why I am so melancholic
I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow.
My pet died today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANGRY
It's frustating how unreliable the results are . It's making me so angry! 
I am angry to work on this project
Damn, He is a hopeless guy 
This show is frustating and irritating to watch
The bear was ravenous, he was fierce and furious
I'm so angry at my boss for yelling at me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEUTRAL

He is chasing the butterflies
I am working on this project
